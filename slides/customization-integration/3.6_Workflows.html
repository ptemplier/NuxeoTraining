### Context <img src="../themes/frog-teacher.png" class="float-left" />
<blockquote><p>
The library administrator wants to publish their books so anyone could have a look at their collection, but wants to make sure they contain valid information prior to their publication.<br /><br />
He has put you in charge to implement something covering his request. Quickly.
</section>

<section class="slide" id="workflows-wherewego">
### What we want to do
#### At the end of the course
- Create a workflow to validate and publish library internal Books
- ...and possibly more workflows on the way :)
</section>

<section class="slide" id="workflow-agenda">
###Agenda
- Concepts
    - Principles used
    - Customization cycle
    - Workflow usage in Nuxeo UI
- Configuration
  - General workflow configuration

## Workflow concepts
</section>

<section class="slide" id="principles">
### Principles used
#### Based on existing infrastructure and using existing features
- **Automation chains**: Powered by Content Automation
- **Layouts**: Dynamic forms using the layout system
- **Notifications**: Using the freemarker templating system
- **Document**: Stored as a structure of documents
</section>

<section class="slide" id="customization-process">
### Customization cycle
#### In Studio, we create the workflows
 - By designing the process using the graph
 - By configuring nodes (steps of the process) and their logic

#### In Nuxeo UI, we launch the workflows
 - Workflows are stored as templates at server start
 - Using one of these templates we start a workflow instance on a document.
 - Workflows can be started from the UI using “Workflow Process” widget or using the StartWorkflow operation.
</section>

<section class="slide" id="innuxeo-1">
###Workflow usage in Nuxeo UI (1/4)
####Summary tab
- Shows available workflows or started workflows

###Creating a new Workflow in Studio

<img alt="workflow-definition" src="img/workflows/workflow-creation.png" class="float-right" />
####New Workflow Definition
- Template that will be used in DM to start workflows on documents

    - ID (must be unique)
        - ID of the declared workflow template
        - Useful for starting a workflow with automation
    - Label
        - Displayed in Nuxeo in the drop down that launches a workflow
        - Supports i18n
    - Description
        - Displayed besides the dropdown list of available workflows, when the corresponding workflow is selected
</section>

<section class="slide" id="workflow-definition">
###Definition Tab
#### To display and edit general information

<img alt="workflow-definition" class="float-right" src="img/workflows/workflow-definition.png"/>

- Label
- Description
- Icons
</section>

<section class="slide" id="workflow-var">
###Variables Tab
####Information that can be accessed during the workflow

- Stores data that comes from user forms or computed by automation chains
- Available for any workflow node using the predefined object WorkflowVariables[]
- *Similarly, we can define node variables available only for that specific node using the predefined object NodeVariables[]*

<img alt="workflow-variables" src="img/workflows/workflow-variables.png" />
</section>


<section class="slide" id="enablements">
### Availability Tab
#### Conditions for the workflow to be available
<img alt="workflow-availability" src="img/workflows/workflow-availability.png" class="float-right" />

- A workflow can be enabled according to
     - document types
     - the current lifecycle state
     - Permissions (ie. read/write right)
     - Facets
     - Path
     - etc.
</section>

<section class="slide" id="graph-editor-graph">
### Graph editor Tab
#### Graphical drag and drop workflow editor

<img alt="workflow-availability" src="img/workflows/workflow-graph-editor.png" class="float-right" />

- Defines the workflow nodes
- Configures their logic
</section>

<section class="slide" id="main-concepts">
### Graph main concepts

#### Graph  <img alt="workflow-graph-node" src="img/workflows/workflow-graph-node.png" class="float-right" />
- The graph is the definition of your process, it contains:
    - A start node
    - One or more end nodes
    - Any other type of node
    - Transitions

#### Nodes
- A node is a step of your workflow
- Can be an automated node not requiring a user action, or a task assigned to one or several users
- Any node can also be a structural node.
- Can be added by drag and drop using the node library

#### Transitions
- Two nodes are linked by a transition
- A condition set on the transition filters the possibility to follow it
- A node can contain one or several transitions

<section class="slide exercise" id="workshop-simple-workflow">
<img src="../nuxeo-slide-template/themes/exercise.svg" alt="exercise"
      class="exercise-icon">
### Practice - Start designing a workflow
- Create a simple workflow having for id <code>bookValidationWorkflow</code>
- Make sure this workflow can be started only on documents of type <code>Book</code>, and only if the user has the Read and Write permissions on the current document
- In the graph, drag and drop a <code>Start</code> and a <code>Stop</code> node using the node library
- Commit and deploy your changes
- In Nuxeo, check that your workflow model exists

## Nodes and transitions configuration
</section>

<section class="slide" id="node-configuration">
###Node Configuration

<img alt="Studio node edition form" class="float-right" src="img/workflows/workflow-node-general-tab.png" />

####General tab
- General information: Title, directive
- Input operation chain
    - The automation chain you specify here will be executed just before the workflow engine enters the node
- Output operation chain
    - The automation chain you specify here will be executed just before the workflow engine leaves the node, and follows the transition(s) if any.
- The documents following the workflow are set by the engine as the input documents when these chains are invoked.
These chains are executed using an unrestricted session!
</section>

<section class="slide" id="node-variable">
###Node Configuration
####Variables tab
- Stores information that can be accessed in the context of the current node during the workflow
- Stores data that comes from user forms or computed by automation chains
- Available in the predefined object
    - <code>NodeVariables["nodeVariableName"]</code>
- A predefined variable called “assignees” exists on every task node
    - Used by <code>Compute Additional Assignees = NodeVariables["assignees"]</code>
- Node variables are available:
    - In the task layouts
    - In the email notification templates
</section>

<section class="slide" id="Transition">
###Node Configuration
####Transition Tab

- Every transition creates an endpoint with the name of the transition, from which you will be able to pull the arrow to connect nodes
- Transition
    - Name: Only displayed in the graph, and used internally by the engine
    - Condition: Condition the workflow engine evaluates in order to know which are the next nodes to be executed after the current one is done.
    - Chain: The automation chain will be executed when the workflow engine goes into this transition

<img alt="workflow-transition-arrow" src="img/workflows/workflow-transition-arrow.png"/>

<section class="slide exercise" id="workshop-nodes-transition">
<img src="../nuxeo-slide-template/themes/exercise.svg" alt="exercise"
      class="exercise-icon">
### Practice - Nodes and transitions

- Retrieve your <code>bookValidationWorkflow</code>
- Add a new node of <code>Node</code> type
    - Edit the node's general information
    - Add a transition named <code>validation</code> and leave the default condition.
    - Upon following this transition, an automation chain named `acceptBook` should be launched.
    - The chain should publish the document in the existing internal Books section: export the document as XML if you need to double-check its path.
- Connect the node to the start and stop nodes
- Commit and deploy your changes
- Create a Book and launch your workflow on it, then check the result

##Questions?
</section>

<section class="slide" id="workflows-initial-context">
### Context <img src="../themes/frog-teacher.png" class="float-left" />
<blockquote><p>
So we did a first attempt at designing a workflow, but that's not really what was expected yet.<br /><br />
We should improve it by implementing correctly the decision process.
</section>

<section class="slide" id="tasks">
## Tasks
</section>

<section class="slide" id="node-Task">
### A special Node: Task
#### Concepts
- Used when the system requires a user intervention to resume the workflow,<br />
Eg. accept/reject task.
- Can have one or multiple assignees
- Waits for an assignee action before going into a transition

#### Task form
- A form can be shown for the assignee to fill it
- The form sets values to
  - Workflow variables
  - Node variables
- User actions (buttons) can be displayed, leading to corresponding transitions
</section>

<section class="slide" id="task-config">
### Task Configuration
#### General Tab (1/5)
<img alt="Studio node edition form" src="img/workflows/workflow-node-general.png" class="float-right" />

- General information: Title, directive
- Due date
    - Set here a scripted expression (MVEL syntax)
    - The dueDate of a task will be  dynamically computed  from this expression when  the workflow is run
- Assignment: Static or dynamic
- Security: Grant specific permissions to the task assignees on the document following the workflow (automatically removed by the workflow engine once the task is completed)
- Notification: Send a custom notification when a task is assigned
- Plugin in custom business logic: Input & output automation chains
</section>

<section class="slide" id="task-config-assignees">
### Task Configuration
#### General tab (2/5)
#### Assignees

<img alt="Studio node edition form" src="img/workflows/workflow-node-assignee.png" class="float-right" />

- Assignees
    - You can add here static assignees, either users or groups, one per input field (click on "add" to add more than one)
    - You can  prefix users by <code>user:</code> like "user:jack" and groups by <code>group:</code> like "group:validators".
- Compute additional assignees
    - You can set here a scripted expression (MVEL syntax) so as to determine how the assignees on that task will be computed at runtime
    - You have access to some useful variables in the context, like the <code>workflowInitiator</code>, <code>nodeLastActor</code>, <code>WorkflowVariables</code>, <code>NodeVariables</code>, <code>CurrentUser</code> and others.
</section>

<section class="slide" id="multiple-tasks">
### Task Configuration
#### General tab (3/5)
#### Multiple tasks
- By default one task will be created for all assignees.
    - The first user completing the task will close it for all other assignees as well.

- When using the <code>multiple tasks</code> node, it is possible to create a task per assignee, by checking the corresponding option.
    - If this option is checked :
        - the engine waits for all users to complete the task before going into a transition
        - specific conditions can be defined for transitions, for example depending on the percentage of approval
</section>

<section class="slide" id="task-config-delegation">
### Task Configuration
#### General tab (4/5)
#### Delegation and reassignment

Tasks in Nuxeo can be delegated or potentially reassigned.

- Allow task reassignment option
    - Used to let the user select other assignees instead of him to accomplish the task
    - Unchecked by default

- Task delegation
    - Native functionality
    - Allows the user to add more assignees to the task but does not remove his assignment

- Delegation and reassignment can be accessed by document's workflow tab or home menu, workflow sub menu
- Tasks can be reassigned or delegated without limit !
</section>

<section class="slide" id="task-config-notifications">
### Task Configuration
#### General tab (5/5)
#### Email notification
- Specify the mail template used for generating the mail sent to the task assignees
- If no template is selected, the task assignees are not notified
- Predefined and custom variables are available, including:
<pre><code>${workflowStartTime}
${workflowInitiator}
${workflowDocuments[docNumber].property}
${workflowDocuments[docNumber].schema.field}
${WorkflowVariables['myVariableName']}
${NodeVariables['myVariableName']}
...
</code></pre>

Workflow email notifications use HTML format. Eg:
<pre><code>A validation request on document ${workflowDocuments[0].dublincore.title} has been started by ${workflowInitiator}.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Click &lt;a href="${docUrl}"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the document.</code></pre>

<img src="../nuxeo-slide-template/themes/exercise.svg" alt="exercise"
      class="exercise-icon">
### Practice - Tasks
#### Update the workflow to add a validation system
- Replace the `Node` node with an `accept/reject` node
- Assign the task to <code>Administrator</code>
- Due date should be the current date
- The assignee should receive a notification email (use the default notification template)
- If the document is accepted, use the chain we created to publish the document and end the workflow.
- If the document is rejected, end the workflow.
- Commit and update your changes.
- Run the workflow and delegate the validation task to Barbara.

### Context <img src="../themes/frog-teacher.png" class="float-left" />
<blockquote><p>
Things are getting better.<br /><br />

Still, there are further improvements we need to achieve. <br />

<section class="slide" id="task-config-form">
### Task Configuration
#### Form tab (1/2)

<img alt="workflow-task-form" src="img/workflows/workflow-task-form.png" class="float-right" />

- Works as a usual form layout
- Defines the form that will be displayed to the user processing the task
- The fields to display can be node or workflow variables
</section>

<section class="slide" id="task-config-buttons">
### Task Configuration
#### Form tab (2/2)
#### Buttons

<img alt="workflow-task-form" src="img/workflows/workflow-task-buttons.png" class="float-right" />

- Configures the buttons displayed for submitting the task form
- Buttons can be linked to transitions

- Id:
    - Stored in the  built-in NodeVariable called "button"
    - Can be used for instance to express conditions for knowing which transition the workflow engine should follow once the current node is done
- Label of the button (supports i18n)
- Filter (available since 5.7): Display the button depending on conditions
- Generates the condition for transition: Creates a transition corresponding to the button in the Transitions tab
</section>

<section class="slide" id="built-variables">
### Built-in Variables
#### Available in

- Chains launched within the nodes (Input chain, output chain, transition chains)
- The condition of a transition
- Additional task assignees (if the expression is resolved to a user or group)
- Due date expression (if the expression is resolved to a date)
</section>

<section class="slide" id="built-variables2">
### Built-in Variables
####List of built-in variables
##### <code>WorkflowVariables</code> and <code>NodeVariables</code> (hashmaps)
- Can store your own variables
- Used like this: <code>NodeVariables[“myNodeVar”]</code> <code>WorkflowVariables[“myWfVar”]</code>

##### <code>NodeVariables["button"]</code>
- Button id that was clicked for processing the task, if the current node is a task node

##### <code>NodeVariables["tasks"].getNumberEndedWithStatus("MyStatus")</code> : how many people have approved / rejected a document for instance
##### <code>NodeVariables["numberOfTasks"]</code> : total number of tasks created (useful to calculate an approval percentage)
##### <code>NodeVariables["numberOfProcessedTasks"]</code>
- When using multiple tasks, these variables are usually combined to calculate approval percentage for instance
 </section>

<section class="slide" id="built-variables3">
### Built-in Variables
####List of built-in variables
##### Context variables
- <code>nodeStartTime</code>
- <code>workflowInitiator</code>
- <code>workflowStartTime</code>
  - Time when the workflow was started
  - Useful for exemple when computing a due date (Due date expression: workflowStartTime.days(8))
- <code>workflowInstanceId</code> and <code>taskDueTime</code>
  - Useful for getting open tasks on a document, and eventually close them using an escalation rule (more details later)

<section class="slide" id="set-workflow">
###How to set workflow and node variables
####From the task form
- The engine will automatically save them when the form is submitted

####From automation chains
- Using *Workflow Context > Set Workflow Variable* <code>SetWorkflowVar</code> and *Set Node Var* <code>SetNodeVar</code> operations
- For instance when the task form should display some pre-initialized variables

### Practice - Task form, workflow variables
#### Implement a validation comment
- Add a workflow variable named <code>validatorsComment</code>, of string type.
- In the accept/reject node's form, add the <code>validatorsComment</code> as a required field so that the validators (in this case the Administrator) can fill his comment.
- In case the document is rejected, send a notification email to the workflow initiator. The email should contain the validator's comment.<br /> Your email template can be created in Studio into the <code>Templates > Mail templates</code> menu.

- Add a button so that the workflow initiator can send the validation task directly to the communication service. This button should generate a transition leading to new nodes.
When this transition is followed:
    - Each group member of the <code>communicationservice</code> group has to be assigned the task.
    - They need temporary access to the document.
    - They should validate or refuse the document within 3 minutes (they're quick !).
    - Add a button and transition for them to potentially refuse the validation.
    - Using transition conditions and variables, make sure the document is approved only if the majority votes for it.

## Escalation rules
</section>

<section class="slide" id="escalation-concepts">
### Escalation rules
#### Concepts
- Used to process automatic tasks on workflows depending on conditions
- A scheduler checks periodically the rules conditions and executes the corresponding chains when evaluated to true
- Escalation rules can be executed once or multiple times
- Escalation rules are only available on suspended task nodes, awaiting for a user action

#### Why do I need them ?
- Common use cases include :
    - Sending friendly reminders by email periodically
    - Close automatically a task / follow a transition if the task due time is over
</section>

<section class="slide" id="escalation-usage">
### Escalation rules
#### Usage
- In task nodes edition, escalation rules are accessible using the corresponding tab.

#### Properties
- Id: unique id for the escalation rule
- Condition: condition to be checked. For example:<br />
<code>@{CurrentDate.calendar.compareTo(Context["taskDueTime"])>0}</code><br />
means "as soon as task due time is over".
- Chain: automation chain to be executed if condition is evaluated to true.
- Multiple execution: chain will be launched only once unless you check that option.
</section>

<section class="slide" id="escalation-chain">
### Escalation rules
#### Related automation chain operations
Operations are available in the <code>workflow context</code> category in order to be used with escalation rules:

#### <code>Get open tasks</code>
- After having fetched the context document, this allows to get open tasks for a specific workflow instance.
- To be used with:
    - The node id (available from the node's general tab)
    - The <code>Context["workflowInstanceId"]</code> variable in order to fetch the workflow instance id.

#### <code>Complete task</code>
- Once open tasks have been fetched, allows to simulate the click of a button by the user in order to follow a transition.

### Practice - Escalation rules
#### Completing a task as soon as due time is over
- In the communication service validation task:
    - add an escalation rule with id <code>closeOnDueTime</code>
    - Set a condition for the rule to be executed as soon as due task time is over
    - The chain should complete the task by following a refusal transition
