<blockquote><p>
The library administrator wants to publish their books so anyone could have a look at their collection, but wants to make sure they contain valid information prior to their publication.<br /><br />
He has put you in charge to implement something covering his request. Quickly.
</section>

<section class="slide" id="workflows-wherewego">
### What we want to do
#### At the end of the course
- Create a workflow to validate and publish library internal Books
- ...and possibly more workflows on the way :)

## Workflow concepts
</section>

<section class="slide" id="principles">
### Principles used
#### Based on existing infrastructure and using existing features
- **Automation chains**: Powered by Content Automation
- **Layouts**: Dynamic forms using the layout system
- **Notifications**: Using the freemarker templating system
- **Document**: Stored as a structure of documents
</section>

<section class="slide" id="customization-process">
### Customization cycle
#### In Studio, we create the workflows
 - By designing the process using the graph
 - By configuring nodes (steps of the process) and their logic

#### In Nuxeo UI, we launch the workflows
 - Workflows are stored as templates at server start
 - Using one of these templates we start a workflow instance on a document.
 - Workflows can be started from the UI using “Workflow Process” widget or using the StartWorkflow operation.
</section>

<section class="slide" id="innuxeo-1">
###Workflow usage in Nuxeo UI (1/4)

###Creating a new Workflow in Studio

<img alt="workflow-definition" src="img/workflows/workflow-creation.png" class="float-right" />
####New Workflow Definition
- Template that will be used in DM to start workflows on documents

    - ID (must be unique)
        - ID of the declared workflow template
        - Useful for starting a workflow with automation
    - Label
        - Displayed in Nuxeo in the drop down that launches a workflow
        - Supports i18n
    - Description
        - Displayed besides the dropdown list of available workflows, when the corresponding workflow is selected

<section class="slide" id="enablements">
### Availability Tab
#### Conditions for the workflow to be available
<img alt="workflow-availability" src="img/workflows/workflow-availability.png" class="float-right" />

- A workflow can be enabled according to
     - document types
     - the current lifecycle state
     - Permissions (ie. read/write right)
     - Facets
     - Path
     - etc.

<section class="slide" id="graph-editor-graph">
### Graph editor Tab
#### Graphical drag and drop workflow editor

<img alt="workflow-availability" src="img/workflows/workflow-graph-editor.png" class="float-right" />

- Defines the workflow nodes
- Configures their logic
</section>

<section class="slide" id="main-concepts">
### Graph main concepts

#### Graph  <img alt="workflow-graph-node" src="img/workflows/workflow-graph-node.png" class="float-right" />
- The graph is the definition of your process, it contains:
    - A start node
    - One or more end nodes
    - Any other type of node
    - Transitions

#### Nodes
- A node is a step of your workflow
- Can be an automated node not requiring a user action, or a task assigned to one or several users
- Any node can also be a structural node
- Can be added by drag and drop using the node library
</section>

<section class="slide exercise" id="workshop-simple-workflow">
<img src="../nuxeo-slide-template/themes/exercise.svg" alt="exercise"
      class="exercise-icon">
### Practice - Start designing a workflow
- Create a simple workflow having for id <code>bookValidationWorkflow</code>
- Make sure this workflow can be started only on documents of type <code>Book</code>, and only if the user has the <code>Read and Write</code> permissions on the current document
- In the graph, drag and drop a <code>Start</code> and a <code>Stop</code> node using the node library, link them together
- Commit and deploy your changes
- In Nuxeo, check that your workflow model exists

</section>

<section class="slide" id="node-types">
### Node Library - Node Types
<blockquote><p>The node library contains templates, that can be customized to your needs.</p></blockquote>

<img class="float-right" src="img/workflows/workflow-node-library.png">

#### Automated tasks
- Is entirely automatic, no user intervention
- Usually used to follow a specific transition depending on metadatas / variables

#### User tasks
- Require one or several users to do something
  - **Simple task**: no button
  - **Approve**: one "approve" button 
  - **Accept/Reject**: two buttons ("accept" and "reject")
  - **Multiple tasks**: allows to create one task per assignee (one for everybody with the other nodes)
  
#### Structural nodes
- Used to force forking, merging or reusing other workflows
</section>

<section class="slide" id="node-Task">
### A Special Node: Task
#### Concepts
- Used when the system requires a user intervention,<br />
Eg. accept/reject task.
- Can have one or multiple assignees
- Waits for an assignee action before resuming the workflow
</section>

<section class="slide" id="task-config">
### Task Configuration
#### General Tab (1/4)
<img alt="Studio node edition form" src="img/workflows/workflow-node-general.png" class="float-right" />

- General information: Title, directive
- Due date
    - Set here a scripted expression (MVEL syntax)
    - The dueDate of a task will be  dynamically computed  from this expression when  the workflow is run
- Assignment: Static or dynamic
- Security: Grant specific permissions to the task assignees on the document following the workflow (automatically removed by the workflow engine once the task is completed)
- Notification: Send a custom notification when a task is assigned
</section>

<section class="slide" id="task-config-assignees">
### Task Configuration
#### General tab (2/4)
#### Assignees

<img alt="Studio node edition form" src="img/workflows/workflow-node-assignee.png" class="float-right" />

- Assignees
    - You can add here static assignees, either users or groups, one per input field (click on "add" to add more than one)
    - You can  prefix users by <code>user:</code> like "user:jack" and groups by <code>group:</code> like "group:validators".
- Compute additional assignees
    - You can set here a scripted expression (MVEL syntax) so as to determine how the assignees on that task will be computed at runtime
    - You have access to some useful variables in the context, like the <code>workflowInitiator</code>, <code>nodeLastActor</code>, <code>WorkflowVariables</code>, <code>NodeVariables</code>, <code>CurrentUser</code> and others.
</section>

<section class="slide" id="task-config-delegation">
### Task Configuration
#### General tab (3/4)
#### Delegation and reassignment

Tasks in Nuxeo can be delegated or potentially reassigned.

- Allow task reassignment option
    - Used to let the user select other assignees instead of him to accomplish the task
    - Unchecked by default

- Task delegation
    - Native functionality
    - Allows the user to add more assignees to the task but does not remove his assignment

- Delegation and reassignment can be accessed by document's workflow tab or home menu, workflow sub menu
- Tasks can be reassigned or delegated without limit !
</section>

<section class="slide" id="task-config-notifications">
### Task Configuration
#### General tab (4/4)
#### Email notification
- Specify the mail template used for generating the mail sent to the task assignees
- If no template is selected, the task assignees are not notified
- Predefined and custom variables are available, including:
<pre><code>${workflowStartTime}
${workflowInitiator}
${workflowDocuments[docNumber].property}
${workflowDocuments[docNumber].schema.field}
${WorkflowVariables['myVariableName']}
${NodeVariables['myVariableName']}
...
</code></pre>

Workflow email notifications use HTML format. Eg:
<pre><code>A validation request on document ${workflowDocuments[0].dublincore.title} has been started by ${workflowInitiator}.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Click &lt;a href="${docUrl}"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the document.</code></pre>

### Transitions
#### Concepts
- Two nodes are linked by a transition
- A condition set on the transition filters the possibility to follow it
- A node can contain one or several transitions
</section>

<section class="slide" id="transitions-tab">
###Node Configuration
####Transition Tab

- Every transition creates an endpoint with the transition's name
    - **Name**: only displayed in the graph, and used internally by the engine.
    - **Condition**: MVEL expression. Evaluated by the workflow engine when the user has finished his task.
    - **Chain**: used to execute some business logic when following a specific transition.

</section>

<section class="slide" id="adding-button">
###Node Configuration
#### Adding a Transition
- A transition can be added:
  - Manually in the transitions tab
  - Automatically when adding a button

#### Adding a Button With its Corresponding Transition
- In the node's '**Form** tab, scroll to the bottom
- Add a task button, leave the condition generation checked

###Workflow and Node Variables
####Concepts
- Store data that comes from user forms or computed by automation chains
- Two kinds of variables can be defined:
  - **Workflow** variables
  - **Node** variables

#### Scope
- **Workflow variables** can be accessed **anytime** during the workflow
- **Node variables** can be accessed **only during the node they are defined in**
</section>

<section class="slide" id="setting-wf-vars">
###Workflow and Node Variables
#### Creating the Variables
- **Workflow variables**: variables tab of the workflow
- **Node variables**: variables tab of a node

#### Filling the Variables Value
- Value is **automatically filled when proposed into a task form**
- Value **can be set using an automation chain** with specific operations (Workflow Context > Set Workflow/Node Variable)

#### Fetching the Variables
- In an MVEL expression, you can use:
  - @{WorkflowVariables["myVarName"]}
  - @{NodeVariables["myVarName"]}
</section>

<section class="slide" id="wf-vars-task-form">
###Node Configuration
#### Task form
- A form can be shown for the assignee to fill it
- The form sets automatically the values filled by the user
- Configuration is similar to a regular layout
- **Only node and workflow variables are suggested**

##### <code>NodeVariables["button"]</code>
- Button id that was clicked for processing the task, if the current node is a task node

##### <code>NodeVariables["tasks"].getNumberEndedWithStatus("MyStatus")</code> : how many people have approved / rejected a document for instance
##### <code>NodeVariables["numberOfTasks"]</code> : total number of tasks created (useful to calculate an approval percentage)
##### <code>NodeVariables["numberOfProcessedTasks"]</code>

<section class="slide" id="set-workflow">
###How to set workflow and node variables
####From the task form
- The engine will automatically save them when the form is submitted

####From automation chains
- Using *Workflow Context > Set Workflow Variable* <code>SetWorkflowVar</code> and *Set Node Var* <code>SetNodeVar</code> operations
- For instance when the task form should display some pre-initialized variables

<section class="slide" id="escalation">
## Escalation rules
</section>

<section class="slide" id="escalation-concepts">
### Escalation rules
#### Concepts
- Used to process automatic tasks on workflows depending on conditions
- A scheduler checks periodically the rules conditions and executes the corresponding chains when evaluated to true
- Escalation rules can be executed once or multiple times
- Escalation rules are only available on suspended task nodes, awaiting for a user action

#### Why do I need them ?
- Common use cases include :
    - Sending friendly reminders by email periodically
    - Close automatically a task / follow a transition if the task due time is over
</section>

<section class="slide" id="escalation-usage">
### Escalation rules
#### Usage
- In task nodes edition, escalation rules are accessible using the corresponding tab.

#### Properties
- Id: unique id for the escalation rule
- Condition: condition to be checked. For example:<br />
<code>@{CurrentDate.calendar.compareTo(Context["taskDueTime"])>0}</code><br />
means "as soon as task due time is over".
- Chain: automation chain to be executed if condition is evaluated to true.
- Multiple execution: chain will be launched only once unless you check that option.
</section>

<section class="slide" id="escalation-chain">
### Escalation rules
#### Related automation chain operations
Operations are available in the <code>workflow context</code> category in order to be used with escalation rules:

#### <code>Get open tasks</code>
- After having fetched the context document, this allows to get open tasks for a specific workflow instance.
- To be used with:
